# HTML and CSS Projects!

This project reflects what I learned in my HTML and CSS course, in which I addressed the following projects:
 - [One Page Website](https://github.com/jccstgo/Proyectos-HTML-y-CSS/tree/main/One-Page-Website)
 - [A Website about Catw](https://github.com/jccstgo/Proyectos-HTML-y-CSS/tree/main/New%20Project)
  - [Website with Bootstrap](https://github.com/jccstgo/Proyectos-HTML-y-CSS/tree/main/bootstrap4_project)

You can find a lot of examples here!
